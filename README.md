source env/bin/activate
Install the dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the application:

Update the database configuration in create_app() function inside app.py to match your PostgreSQL database settings.
Optionally, modify any other configuration parameters as per your requirements.
Run the database migrations:

Copy code
flask db upgrade
Run the application:

Copy code
python app.py
The Flask development server will start, and you can access the API at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
The Flask Hotel API provides the following endpoints:

GET /tasks: Retrieves a list of all tasks in the hotel.
GET /housekeepers: Retrieves a list of all housekeepers in the hotel.
GET /guests: Retrieves a list of all guests in the hotel.
GET /rooms: Retrieves a list of all rooms in the hotel.
You can test these endpoints using tools like cURL or Postman.

Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

├── sita.py                      (Script to populate database with fake data)
└── requirements.txt             (Python dependencies)
The Flask application resides in the app.py file. The API endpoints for housekeepers, tasks, guests, and rooms are implemented in separate modules under the src/api directory.

The src/models.py file contains the database models for Guest, Room, Task, and Housekeeper.

The sita.py script is included to populate the database with fake data using the faker library. You can run this script to generate random housekeepers, rooms, guests, and tasks.

Database Migrations
The Flask Hotel API uses Flask-Migrate for managing database migrations. When you make changes to the models or create new ones, you need to generate and apply the migrations.

To generate a new migration:

arduino
Copy code
flask db migrate -m "Add guests table"
To apply the migrations:

Copy code
flask db upgrade
For more information on using Flask-Migrate, refer to the Flask-Migrate documentation.
